# SimpliAsk

Your personal virtual health assistant who will address your health concerns. 

# Inspiration
The Covid-19 pandemic has affected millions globally and it has overwhelmed health care workers around the globe. This outbreak has created an environment where an individual must do a self-assessment before traveling anywhere and SimpliAsk makes this process very simple. To solve this widespread issue I decided to create an app that can assist your health needs. 

# What it does
SimpliAsk is a platform that has integrated logging systems, patient health checks, doctor and patient interaction, and a personalized voice-activated assistant that makes users feel assured that they remain safe. Anytime patients fill out self-assessment forms via their doctor, the information is logged so the patient can review their symptoms from any given day. Patients are able to communicate with their doctor through a chat feature. The voice-activated assistant is able to detect patient inputs and is able to give feedback accordingly. 

# How I built it
The login and sign-up pages for SimpliAsk were made from react-native and CSS. In the backend of the verification pages, I used a database to safely store the login credentials of patients and doctors. The functionality of the app was coded in python scripts and was used through a Rest API. I used Firebase to create a real-time chat between patients and doctors.  

# Challenges I ran into
Some challenges that I faced while developing SimpliAsk was using a python script to create a voice-assistant. It required many components including ... I also had some trouble with ...

# What I learned
During the designing and development of SimpliAsk I learning how to use react-native and create an app which can be accessed by both doctors and patients. I also learned how to implement a database and a Rest API to the backend of our project. Overall, this project allowed us to strengthen our skills in using a variety of programming languages and integrating them together for a great application.

# What's next for SimpliAsk
The future of Simpliask is to add many additional features such as an inbox for both patients and doctors, dietary plans for patients to follow, and evolve over time based on user feedback through the use of AI. I also plan to publish SimpliAsk on the playstore to allow users to interact with the app and provide us with feedback.
